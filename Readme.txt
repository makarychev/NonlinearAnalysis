The module is used to work with nonlinear analysis theory in practice.
Implemented:
 - evaluating correlation dimension by time series;

In order to build solution you need to add such enviroment variables to your system:
1) %PYTHON% - enviroment variable path to python (in my case its Anaconda 2.7.10 x86);
2) %BOOST%  - enviroment variable path to boost directory (version 1.59.0);
3) %GSL%	- enviroment variable path to GSL (Guidlines support library https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL.git)
